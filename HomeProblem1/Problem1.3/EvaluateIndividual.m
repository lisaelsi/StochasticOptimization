% EvaluateIndividual: This function should take the vector of variables 
% (x) as input, and should return the (note!) fitness value, which in this 
% case should be taken as (g(x1, x2) + 1)âˆ’1, keeping in mind that g(x1, x2)
% is clearly non-negative but might (perhaps) take the value 0. You should
% hardcode the function in EvaluateIndividual (i.e. you should not place
% the function in a separate file) and then also hardcode the computation 
% of the fitness value. Check carefully that you enter the function
% g(x1, x2) correctly!
